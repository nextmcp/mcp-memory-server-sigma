## Current Status

### Production Readiness: **Beta** 🟡
The system is functional and deployed in production environments, but has areas for improvement:

**Strengths:**
- Core functionality stable and tested
- Graceful degradation handles failures
- Infrastructure automation complete
- Security basics in place

**Limitations:**
- Limited test coverage
- No comprehensive monitoring
- Performance not optimized for scale
- Some features need hardening

### Development Velocity: **Active** 🟢
- Regular updates and improvements
- Active issue resolution
- Community feedback integration
- Documentation maintenance

### Technical Debt: **Low** 🟢
- Clean architecture with clear patterns
- Well-organized codebase
- Type hints and validation
- Minimal code smells

### Known Limitations

#### Sync Mechanism
- **Issue**: 30-minute sync interval means eventual consistency
- **Impact**: Recent memories may not be searchable immediately
- **Workaround**: Manual sync via `/sync` endpoint
- **Future**: Real-time sync or shorter intervals with optimization

#### Slack Integration
- **Issue**: Large channel history takes time to load
- **Impact**: Initial load can timeout for channels with 10K+ messages
- **Workaround**: Use `days` parameter to limit history
- **Future**: Incremental loading and background processing

#### Vector Search Fallback
- **Issue**: Text search (fallback) less accurate than vector search
- **Impact**: Reduced search quality when Qdrant unavailable
- **Mitigation**: System remains functional, logs warning
- **Future**: Better text search algorithms

#### Single OpenAI Provider
- **Issue**: Locked into OpenAI for embeddings
- **Impact**: Vendor lock-in, API rate limits
- **Workaround**: Configuration supports multiple providers
- **Future**: Implement additional embedding providers

#### No Memory Versioning
- **Issue**: Updates overwrite previous memory content
- **Impact**: Can't revert to previous versions
- **Workaround**: State history tracks changes
- **Future**: Full versioning system

## Known Issues

### Active Issues
None currently documented. System is stable.

### Resolved Issues

#### Issue: Server crash when Qdrant unavailable
- **Date**: Before current template state
- **Resolution**: Implemented lazy client initialization with `get_memory_client_safe()`
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### Issue: Sync clears all Qdrant data on failure
- **Date**: Before current template state
- **Resolution**: Added try-catch around sync operations, clear per-user
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### Issue: Memory created in wrong user context
- **Date**: Before current template state
- **Resolution**: Context variables for proper SSE connection isolation
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### Issue: Slack memories accessible to wrong users
- **Date**: Before current template state
- **Resolution**: Dedicated "slack-bot" user, separate search tool
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution

#### Phase 1: Initial Design
- **Original**: Single database (PostgreSQL only)
- **Issue**: Poor semantic search performance
- **Change**: Added Qdrant for vector search
- **Result**: 10x improvement in search quality

#### Phase 2: Storage Strategy
- **Original**: Qdrant as primary storage
- **Issue**: Data loss on container restart
- **Change**: PostgreSQL as source of truth, sync to Qdrant
- **Result**: Data durability with search performance

#### Phase 3: Error Handling
- **Original**: Fail-fast on dependency unavailability
- **Issue**: Server crashes blocked all operations
- **Change**: Graceful degradation with fallbacks
- **Result**: High availability even with failures

### Integration Evolution

#### Slack Integration Iterations
1. **V1**: Each user loads their own Slack data
   - Problem: Complex permissions, duplication
   
2. **V2**: Shared "slack-bot" user owns all Slack data
   - Problem: Still needed ACL checks
   
3. **V3 (Current)**: Dedicated search tool, no ACL
   - Result: Simplified, performant, intuitive

#### MCP Implementation Journey
1. **V1**: HTTP POST for each operation
   - Problem: No persistent connection, slow
   
2. **V2**: WebSocket transport
   - Problem: Complex state management
   
3. **V3 (Current)**: SSE transport with context vars
   - Result: Simple, stateless, reliable

### Configuration Evolution

#### Embedding Models
1. **V1**: text-embedding-ada-002
   - Cost: High
   
2. **V2**: text-embedding-3-small
   - Cost: 5x cheaper, similar quality
   
3. **V3 (Current)**: Configurable via config.json
   - Flexibility: Easy to switch providers

#### Sync Strategy
1. **V1**: Sync on every memory operation
   - Problem: Slow, expensive
   
2. **V2**: Batch sync every 5 minutes
   - Problem: Inconsistency visible to users
   
3. **V3 (Current)**: 30-minute interval + manual trigger
   - Balance: Freshness vs. overhead
